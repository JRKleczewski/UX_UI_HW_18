        <h3>User Research</h3>
    </div>
        <p>Through utilizing surveys, testing plans, and in-person interviews, I like to get a feeling of my users frustrations, thoughts, desires, and problems
        </p>
    <div Class= "workGrid">
        <h3>USER EMPATHY </h3>
        <p>When interviewing and testing on users, I want to understand why they go to certain areas and the thought process behind it.  It is important to understand the user because that is who we design for, not myself.
        </p>
    </div> 
        <h3>QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS</h3>
        <p>It is important to approach a design with factual data that comes straight from the user.  Designing on assumption will always fail because discountings the users thoughts and data will never create a proper experience.  Through synthesizing data, we can see who the true user is and it gives more meaning to the design</p>
